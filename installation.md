# Installation

Firstly, you must install Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Knowledge of Docker is not needed, but it may be useful to know that it is a way to package software with a list of prerequisites so that it can be run on any hardware. Images can be built, which are then run (individual running instances of images are known as containers), behaving the same on any machine they are run on.
